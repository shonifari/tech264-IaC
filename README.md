## IaC overview

### What is IaC?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. This approach allows for automation and consistency in setting up environments.

### Benefits of IaC

- **Consistency**: Ensures that the same environment is created every time, reducing configuration drift and errors.
- **Efficiency**: Automates repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing manual effort.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales infrastructure up or down based on demand.
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure configurations can be versioned and tracked, similar to application code.
- **Cost Savings**: Reduces the need for manual intervention, lowering operational costs.

### When/Where to Use IaC

IaC is useful in various scenarios, including:

- **Development and Testing**: Quickly spin up and tear down environments for development and testin.
- **Production Deployments**: Ensure consistent and reliable deployments in production environment.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Rapidly recreate infrastructure in case of failure.
- **Multi-Cloud Management**: Manage infrastructure across multiple cloud provider.

### Tools Available for IaC

- **Terraform**: A popular open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: A service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources.
- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**: Provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account.
- **Google Cloud Deployment Manager**: Allows you to specify all the resources needed for your application in a declarative format.
- **Ansible**: An open-source tool for IT automation, configuration management, and provisioning.
- **Chef**: Automates the process of managing and configuring infrastructure.
- **Puppet**: Manages the configuration of Unix-like and Microsoft Windows systems.

### What is Configuration Management (CM)?

Configuration Management (CM) is a process for maintaining computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state. It involves tracking and controlling changes in the software, hardware, and documentation to ensure that the system remains functional and reliable.

### What is Provisioning of Infrastructure? Do CM Tools Do It?

Provisioning of infrastructure involves setting up the necessary hardware and software resources to support an application or service. This includes creating virtual machines, configuring networks, and setting up storage. Some CM tools, like Ansible and Chef, also handle provisioning tasks, automating the setup of infrastructure components.

### What is Ansible and How Does It Work?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. It works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules," to perform tasks. These modules are executed over SSH, and the results are returned to the Ansible server.

### Who is Using IaC and Ansible in the Industry?

Many organizations across various industries use IaC and Ansible, including:

- **Technology Companies**: For automating cloud infrastructure and managing large-scale deployments.
- **Financial Services**: To ensure compliance and security in their IT environments.
- **Healthcare**: For managing complex IT infrastructure and ensuring data integrity.
- **Retail**: To handle dynamic scaling of resources during peak shopping seasons.
